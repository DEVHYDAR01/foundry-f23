# Foundry-F23

Welcome to the `foundry-f23` repository! This project serves as a practical exploration of Foundry, a high-performance Ethereum development toolkit written in Rust. Through this repository, I am delving into smart contract development, testing, and deployment, guided by the Cyfrin Updraft course.

## üöÄ Overview

Foundry is a modular suite of tools designed to streamline Ethereum application development. It encompasses:

- **Forge**: A fast and flexible testing framework.
- **Cast**: A command-line tool for interacting with the Ethereum network.
- **Anvil**: A local Ethereum node for development and testing.
- **Foundryup**: A tool for managing Foundry versions.

This repository includes implementations of various smart contract projects, each serving as a learning milestone in the course.

## üìÇ Projects

### 1. `foundry-fund-me-f23`
A smart contract that allows users to donate Ether, with a minimum donation threshold denominated in USD. It leverages Chainlink price feeds to ensure accurate valuation.

### 2. `foundry-simple-storage-f23`
A basic contract demonstrating state variable manipulation and gas optimization techniques.
